## For Project: Similarity-aware Circle Packing
## Calculating the maximum inscribed circle of an arbitrary convex polygon in 2D space

This algorithm calculates the center and radius of the maximum inscribed circle of an arbitrary convex polygon in 2D space.

### Inputs
A list of points coordinates which are the vertices of the polygon.
### Outputs
The center and radius of the maximum inscribed circle.
### How to use
Call the function max_inscribed_circle(points) with a list of the points coordinates which are the vertices of the polygon as an argument. The function returns the center and radius of the maximum inscribed circle.
